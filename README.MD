A test app for a take-home test, simulating a simple registry of buildings and their owners.

The app comes with an in-memory database that gets populated with some sample data on startup.

Either simply run the provided .jar via command line by typing 'java -jar filename', or import the project into your favourite IDE and run it there (JDK 1.8+ required).
After launching, you can access the documentation and try out the available options in the swagger interface at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html (or, alternatively, manually access the endpoints).
